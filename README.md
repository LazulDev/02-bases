# Bases

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.7. Yey ðŸ¥³
This a simple project to get familiar with out-of-the-box Angular v17 control flow syntax.

For `@if` condition and `@for` loop usage check, in example, [`ListComponent`](https://github.com/LazulDev/02-bases/blob/main/src/app/dbz/components/list/list.component.html) template.

Based on [Angular: De cero a experto](https://cursos.devtalles.com/courses/angular) course by [Fernando Herrera](https://fernando-herrera.com/#/home)
